      <h2>The Programs</h2>
      <p>The Institute of African Studies encourages an interdisciplinary
         approach to research and training. It actively helps students design a
         program of study that combines individual interests with career goals.</p>
      <p>Undergraduate students may elect a course plan leading to a major or
         minor in African studies. Graduate students may either complete a
         regional concentration or a certificate in African studies in
         conjunction with an advanced degree from one of Columbia's various
         schools and departments. The certificate requires proficiency in an
         African language such as Swahili, Hausa, Wolof, Zulu or Arabic, courses
         which are all taught at Columbia. There is no course of study leading to
         a degree in African Studies at the Graduate level as yet.</p>
      <p>A combined program with the Teachers College is also offered, leading to
         the Africa certificate and the <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">Ph.D.</abbr> in education or the <abbr title="Doctor of Education">Ed.D. degree.</abbr></p>
